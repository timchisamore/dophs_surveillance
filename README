Diseases of Public Health Significance Surveillance

This R project takes integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) data for the Diseases of Public Health Significance (DOPHS) and produces a surveillance report. This is in accordance with the Ministry of Health and Long-term Care (MOHLTC) requirements that municipal health units conduct this surveillance.

Specifically, the surveillance report contains monthly and year-to-month counts for each disease in the current year. As well, a 5-year average and range of the year-to-month values from the previous years is included for reference.

This report should always be run at the beginning of the month to produce surveillance for the previous month. Use drake::r_make() to do so and the output will be in the documents folder.
