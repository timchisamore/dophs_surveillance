#' Filtering iPHIS data
#'
#' This function takes the clean iPHIS data and filters to ensure only cases
#' meeting defintion are included. For example, cases of chlamydial infections
#' can have a classification of confirmed or probable while cases of hepatitis C
#' must have a classification of confirmed.
#'
#' @param clean_iphis_data A tbl_df of clean iPHIS data.
#'
#' @return A tbl_df of filtered iPHIS data.
